# Neural-Network
It's a projet made for myself as an initiation inside of the world of neural-networks. This projet is made exclusively in C++ and is strongly inspired by the video of Sebastian Lague

[How to Create a Neural Network (and Train it to Identify Doodles) - Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c)

## Installation
There is no external installation necessary for this project other than C++. I'm using Visual Studio 2022 as the IDE, but you can choose whichever you prefere.
```
1) Open NeuralNetwork.sln
2) Run the neural network
3) Sketch a doodle
4) Observe the neural network prediction
